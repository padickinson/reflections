Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: Create a .git directory to store the repository data
Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Staging provides a way to specify which set of changes should be grouped together for a commit. This makes it easier to break up commits logically.
Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: By using git diff, git diff --staged, and git diff <commit old> <commit new>, we can see all the changes between working dir, staging area, most recent commit, other commits. By using git add we can add changes to the staging area to make up a logical unit for committing.
Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A: Branches are useful for working on changes / refactors / features etc. that are more complex than a single commit, and which are not ready to be merged into the main (master) branch
